# Formatting into the danger zone

> Pwn - 300pts

The program asks for a password, but it seems it prints the supplied password in a dangerous manner. Are you able to extract the flag?

IP and port: `95.85.37.12:1337`

PS: This is a pwn assignment, but you are not expected to pwn the machine, only extract the flag
PPS: connect using `nc <ip> <port>`
